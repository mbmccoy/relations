# How to reproduce the results

The notebooks in this folder are designed to run in Google Colab. The notebook `generate_data.ipynb` requires an A100 GPU machine, and the notebook `analyze_results.ipynb` requires only a high-ram CPU machine. The notebooks also require connecting to a Google Drive, and saving data at specific locations. See the notebooks for details.
